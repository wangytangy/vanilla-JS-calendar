# Code Exercise - Calendar

[Live Demo of the calendar](https://wangytangy.github.io/vanilla-JS-calendar/)

### Changes and Improvements
- additional animation such as sliding transitions
- provide documentation for other developers
- remove all hardcoded HTML and instead create all scaffolding elements using Javascript
- ensure the calendar is fully responsive on all browsers and devices (via media queries, setting viewport, using relative units instead of pixels for CSS)

### Production-Ready Features
- write unit tests for the Calendar class functions

- if this calendar is for displaying read-only dates, implement different views such as displaying the full calendar with the date highlighted or a text input view, or highlighting days

- for date selection, implement features such as selecting a range of dates, disabling selection of certain dates, constraining selection to a min or max date

- toolbar navigation with buttons to go to "today" or one year from current date or dropdown menus to select specific months and years

- create separate views for a day, week, and month

- include ability to choose preferred date format such as "yyyy/mm/dd" and storing user preferences in a stateful structure such as a cookie

- add keyboard shortcuts like using arrow keys or browsing days or enter key for confirming selection
